<h1>How it Works</h1>
<h4>IMPORTANT: Only use wallets that allow you to receive Bitcoin from the same address you sent from. If you're not sure, test with .001 Bitcoins. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible.</h4>
<p>SatoshiDice is a subroutine of an advanced artificial intelligence, which arose spontaneously as one of the less-harmful consequences of the United States' quantitative easing monetary program. The system exists solely within the RAM of an abandoned Nokia 3310 mobile phone which was left in a subway station in Tokyo, and powers itself by feeding off the ghost of the late Satoshi Nakamoto (who was in fact a super hot 20 yr old female Japanese programmer and exotic animal collector). While the Intelligence decides on its next course of action, it runs this SatoshiDice subroutine. Some people ask why Bitcoin was really created... it was created by the Intelligence  as an internet currency which enables free individuals around the world to play the SatoshiDice game. By playing, you are fulfilling the Intelligence's Grand Vision.</p>
<p><strong>On the specifics of the system:</strong></p>
<p>The SatoshiDice Bitcoin game operates with zero confirmations, meaning the time it takes for you to send a transaction and receive your winnings is near-instant.  Bets are evaluated as soon as the client picks up the broadcast.  This is safe   because it always builds the answering transaction with the output of your bet transaction.  This means a blockchain that does not contain your bet cannot contain the site's answer. </p>

<p>You place a bet by sending bitcoins to one of the addresses listed in the bet options table.  SatoshiDice sees this, evaluates win or lose and generates a return transaction.  If you lose, the return is one half the house edge.  That means a number way lower than your bet.  If you win, your bet is multiplied by the prize multiplier and that amount is sent back.</p>

<p>There is thus an answering transaction for each bet and normally you see that transaction in your client after a few seconds.  </p>

<h2>Multiple Bets</h2>

<p>If desired, you can put multiple bets in a single transaction.  Just put in multiple outputs to as many of the bet option addresses as you want.  Each bet will be evaluated and paid.  All the bets from one transaction will have the same lucky number.</p>

<h2>Delays</h2>

<p>If there is a problem with the software there might be delays in processing bets or creating return transactions.  A transaction will always be evaluated with the date of when it was first seen by the software.  This means if your transaction comes in on the 1st, the software will tag the transaction with that date.  Then if the transaction fails and the program explodes, and it's not fixed until the 2nd, your transaction will still use the 1st for the purpose of lucky number selection.  </p>


<h2>Problems</h2>

<p> Contact the system via the Twitter account <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120508030355/https://twitter.com/#!/satoshidice">@SatoshiDice</a></p>

<h2>Min/Max Bets</h2>

<p>
Because there is only  a limited pool of funds to back bets, there is a max bet for each bet option.    The max changes periodically also  as bets are processed making what was previously a valid bet invalid as other bets are processed and paid.  In this case, the bet will be returned before evaluating for win or loss.  </p>
<p>SatoshiDice is the best Bitcoin game in existence. The Intelligence is sure you will agree.</p>

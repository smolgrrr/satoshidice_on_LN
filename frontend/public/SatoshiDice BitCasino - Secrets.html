<h1>Secret Keys</h1>
<p>In order to ensure that there is no way for the system to change the outcome of a bet, the secret keys  used in the hash are 
decided ahead of time.  They are not released right away, since they could be used to submit selective transactions and 
win bets unfairly.  However, the hash of the secrets is released in the following days so that users can verify that preceeding bets were provably fair.</p>

<h2>Days</h2>
<p>Each bet transaction that comes in is assigned to the secret key of the current day when it is first processed.  In most cases this will be as soon as the transaction is broadcast on the bitcoin network.  However it could be later if the system has some problems processing or  an outage.  All times are in GMT.</p>

<h2>Hash File</h2>
The system has a file of all the hash keys for the next 10 years: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044510/https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/satoshidice/hash.keys">hash.keys</a>

This file can be verified in several ways.  The simplest is to simply download and keep a copy of that file.  If ever your copy and the copy we are distributing disagree there is something awry.  

The other way is to use a package called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044510/https://github.com/fireduck64/BitcoinTimestamp">BitcoinTimestamp</a>.  This is something which stores a sha256 sum in the bitcoin network as a transaction.  Since this transaction goes into the block chain, it is impossible for anyone to tamper with after the fact.  

<p>There the sha256 sum of the file stored in S3 and the sha256 sum stored in transaction <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120508044510/http://blockchain.info/search?search=428bcc630b00fe431623b4e1fb0f726493dc0a2ead86ace9f65cd51bc8092459">428bcc630b00fe431623b4e1fb0f726493dc0a2ead86ace9f65cd51bc8092459</a> match.  This shows the file has existed since the time of the transaction on 2012-04-18.</p>

<p>In case you just want the hash of the file without validation:
</p><pre>$ sha256sum hash.keys
9b0d87ac871518cfd8601aa456b58fa74c01194cfeb25e7f3eecf43759d6ccb4  hash.keys
$ sha1sum hash.keys
d5f03cad9c3e0e2fac85fd0ba110d41fb31a20e2  hash.keys
$ md5sum hash.keys
15cd77530c41e4d6b1f4802b6bdd1c83  hash.keys
</pre><p></p>
<h2>Secrets</h2>
<p>So that is all well and good for the hashes but those are just hashes, not the actual secrets used.  After a day has been over for at least 24 hours the system will release the secret used.  Then you can verify that the hash of the secret matches the published hash in the hash file.  This demonstrates that the system used the secret it promised it would use.</p>

<h2>Lucky Number</h2>
<p>The lucky number used to determine the winner of games is simple.  It is simply the first bytes of hmac_sha512(secert,txid).  That would be the secret string as the key and the transaction ID of your bet transaction as the data.</p>

<p>You can see all of this on the full details page for your transaction.</p>

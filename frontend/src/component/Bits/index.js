<h1>How it Works</h1>
<h4>IMPORTANT: Only use wallets that accept LNURL. If you're not sure, test with 100 sats. If you get nothing back, then your wallet is not compatible.</h4>
<p>LNLNSatoshiDice is a subroutine of an advanced artificial intelligence, which arose spontaneously as one of the less-harmful consequences of the United States' quantitative easing monetary program. The system exists solely within the RAM of an abandoned Nokia 3310 mobile phone which was left in a subway station in Tokyo, and powers itself by feeding off the ghost of the late Satoshi Nakamoto (who was in fact a super hot 20 yr old female Japanese programmer and exotic animal collector). While the Intelligence decides on its next course of action, it runs this LNSatoshiDice subroutine. Some people ask why Bitcoin was really created... it was created by the Intelligence  as an internet currency which enables free individuals around the world to play the LNSatoshiDice game. By playing, you are fulfilling the Intelligence's Grand Vision.</p>
<p><strong>On the specifics of the system:</strong></p>
<p>The LNLNSatoshiDice Bitcoin game operates with the lightning network, meaning the time it takes for you to send a transaction and receive your winnings is near-instant.  Bets are evaluated as soon as the client picks up the broadcast.  This is safe   because it always builds the answering transaction with the output of your bet transaction.  This means a blockchain that does not contain your bet cannot contain the site's answer. </p>

<p>You place a bet by sending bitcoins to the LNURLp given by the bet button.  LNSatoshiDice sees this, evaluates win or lose and generates a return transaction.  If you lose, you recieve nothing.  If you win, your bet is multiplied by the prize multiplier and that amount is sent back via LNURLw.</p>

<p>There is thus an answering transaction for each bet and normally you see that transaction in your client after a few seconds.  </p>

<h2>Delays</h2>

<p>If there is a problem with the software there might be delays in processing bets or creating return transactions.  A transaction will always be evaluated with the date of when it was first seen by the software.  This means if your transaction comes in on the 1st, the software will tag the transaction with that date.  Then if the transaction fails and the program explodes, and it's not fixed until the 2nd, your transaction will still use the 1st for the purpose of lucky number selection.  </p>


<h2>Problems</h2>

<p> Contact the system via the Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/smolgrrr">@Smolgrrr</a></p>

<h2>Min/Max Bets</h2>

<p>
Because there is only  a limited pool of funds to back bets, there is a max bet for each bet option.    The max changes periodically also  as bets are processed making what was previously a valid bet invalid as other bets are processed and paid.  In this case, the bet will be returned before evaluating for win or loss.  </p>
<p>LNSatoshiDice is the best Bitcoin game in existence. The Intelligence is sure you will agree.</p>
